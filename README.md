# acquisitions
The following model explains how to evaluate the conditions for growing an operational department organically or through mergers & acquisitions.
The example is based on Lead Generation, which is at the top of the funnel for many service companies. 

$$$
\(V_i = \frac{Q_i}{C_i + T_i}\)
$$$


1. **Cost of Expanding the In-House Team (C_i)**: This includes hiring and training new employees, the cost of the tools and software they will need, and the ongoing cost of salaries and benefits.
    
2. **Time to Expand the In-House Team (T_i)**: The time it takes to hire and train new team members can be significant, and during this time, the company may not be generating as many leads as possible.
    
3. **Increase in Lead Quality from Expanding In-House Team (Q_i)**: An expanded in-house team may generate higher quality leads because they have a deeper understanding of the company and its products or services. This could lead to a higher conversion rate.
    
4. **Cost of Buying an External Company (C_e)**: This includes the purchase price of the company, as well as any ongoing costs associated with maintaining and operating the company.
    
5. **Time to Integrate an External Company (T_e)**: It may take time to integrate the operations of the external company into the main business. During this time, there may be a drop in lead generation.
    
6. **Increase in Lead Quality from External Company (Q_e)**: The quality of leads generated by the external company may not be as high as those generated by an expanded in-house team, which could lead to a lower conversion rate.
    
7. **Distraction from Main Business (D)**: Buying an external company could divert focus and resources from the main business, which could harm overall performance.
