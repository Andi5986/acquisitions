# Valuation Model for Organic Growth vs M&A for Operational Departments
The following model explains how to evaluate the conditions for growing an operational department organically or through mergers & acquisitions.
The example is based on Lead Generation, which is at the top of the funnel for many service companies. 

**For expanding the in-house team:**

$$
\(V_i = \frac{Q_i}{C_i + T_i}\)
$$

**For buying an external company:**

$$
\(V_e = \frac{Q_e \times (1 - R)}{C_e + T_e + D}\)
$$

**Where:**

- \(C_i\): Cost of expanding the in-house team. This includes hiring and training new employees, the cost of the tools and software they will need, and the ongoing cost of salaries and benefits. 
- \(T_i\): Time to expand the in-house team. The time it takes to hire and train new team members can be significant, and during this time, the company may not be generating as many leads as possible.
- \(Q_i\): Increase in lead quality from expanding in-house team. Can be represented by the expected yearly revenue. An expanded in-house team may generate higher quality leads because they have a deeper understanding of the company and its products or services. This could lead to a higher conversion rate.
- \(C_e\): Cost of buying an external company. This includes the purchase price of the company, as well as any ongoing costs associated with maintaining and operating the company.
- \(T_e\): Time to integrate an external company. It may take time to integrate the operations of the external company into the main business. During this time, there may be a drop in lead generation.
- \(Q_e\): Increase in lead quality from external company. Can be represented by the expected yearly revenue. The quality of leads generated by the external company may not be as high as those generated by an expanded in-house team, which could lead to a lower conversion rate.
- \(D\): Distraction from main business. Buying an external company could divert focus and resources from the main business, which could harm overall performance.
- \(R\): Risk probability associated with the quality of leads from the external company. Represents the expected increase in lead quality from the external company, taking into account the risk probability. If the risk probability is high, this will reduce the expected increase in lead quality, and vice versa.
